My environment for doing stuff

putting it into a repo, so i will know where to search for it ;-)

I tend to put little scripts for personal use into .bashrc as functions or aliases, this way it is easier to look them up.

now that i have this archive there is one more thing to remember - to backup the scripts when they change...
